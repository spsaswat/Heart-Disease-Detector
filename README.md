# Heart Disease Detector
Using Data visualization/analysis, and machine learning models to build a model for detecting heart disease. Different machine learning models were trained and their performances were compared to find the best model.
After finding out that <b>Random Forest</b> performs the best, now it is time to deploy the model.

# Deploying the model using AWS
